Git & GitHub Activities
=========

In the breakout rooms, each person should individually complete following tasks. The goal is muddle your way through - git can be difficult. Let's practice in low stakes environment. When get stuck ask someone else in the breakout rooms to help you.

There are two sets of activities:

1. [Learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
    
    "Learn git branching" is absolute fundamentals. Feel to skip if you have any hands-on experience with git.

    It is entirely in-browser.


2. [Git Exercises](https://gitexercises.fracz.com/)

    "Git Exercises" is more involved. You do not to complete it. The goal is to get more experience with git commands.

    It is combination of in-browser and local. You work locally but it syncs with the browser version.
