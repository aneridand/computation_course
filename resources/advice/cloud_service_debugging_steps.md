GitHub Classroom Addendum
----


### Create a repo

If you have tried all of the above and a GitHub Classroom assignment hangs before completing it setup, ask the instructor to delete your repo in the admin section.

If it still does not work, you should try to create a new GitHub username. For some unknown reason, a new GitHub username always works.


### Making commits

It is best practice to commit your work early and often. The easiest way to commit is through the repl.it user interface. However sometimes that does not work. 

If commiting is not working, type the following at repl.it command line (far right panel with black background):

`rm .git/index.lock`

After trying all of the above steps and things are still not working, try to commit updates directly on the GitHub website. Directions are [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository).  

Remember - Keep the goal the goal. The goal is commit to your code to the `master` branch of your homework repo.
