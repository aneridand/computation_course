Prework
======


Required
------

Before the start of class you __must__ have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account and be able to login. In class, we are going to creating EC2 Instance on AWS. If I see you signing up for AWS during class, I'll dock you for not coming to class prepared.

You need to watch the following videos and complete the prework check on Canvas. The prework check is open resource, feel to consult the video or any other material to answer the questions. Check Canvas for the due date and time.
